    <h2 class="major-header">Who We Are</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Base Camp Coding Academy is a school based in Water Valley, Mississippi
      that offers a year-long <strong>tuition-free</strong> program to high
      school graduates. Upon acceptance into the program, students are taught
      computer programming, <em>regardless of experience</em> in a hands-on
      setting, which includes:
    </p>
    <h3 class="minor-header">1. Front-End Development</h3>
    <p class="text">
      Front-end developers use languages such as HTML and CSS to create the
      things a user sees while going through a website, for example.
    </p>
    <h3 class="minor-header">2. Back-End Development</h3>
    <p class="text">
      Back-end developers use languages such as Python to create several
      different processes, which users are unable to see.
    </p>
    <h3 class="minor-header">3. Professionalism</h3>
    <p class="text">
      You read that correctly! Along with programming, Base Camp aims to teach
      their students personal skills they will need to land a job, including
      interviewing, leadership, and effective communication.
    </p>
    <h2 class="major-header">The Role of Social Media</h2>
    <p class="text">
      In our current age, a strong social media presence is paramount to being
      successful. Along with their websites, schools often use at least one
      social media page, if not more, to increase relations and communication
      with parents and students. Due to the influx of Twitter posts, which can
      reach up to 500 million daily, schools sometimes compete when appearing in
      a feed, or even being read when appearing. To combat this, posts will
      often include at least one photo, which can be used to convey an emotion
      or idea, but is also important in increasing user interaction. It's shown
      that posts will gain 94% more views if a video or photo is included, which
      should be no surprise considering 64% of the population relies on visual
      learning.
    </p>
    <h2 class="major-header">Why We Need Cameras</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Currently, the Documentation Team, a group of students that manages all of
      Base Camp's social media accounts, attempts to put a post out at least
      twice a week, though the team is hoping to take on more challenges, such
      as writing a newsletter. While two of the students own phones with
      impressive camera capabilities, they aren't always available for
      photography, causing some posts to contain lackluster images. We believe
      that the addition of cameras will improve the quality of all photos taken
      in the future.
    </p>
    <h2 class="major-header">Our Goal</h2>
    <p class="text">
      The purpose of this fundraiser is to allow the school to purchase at least
      two cameras which are to be dedicated for school use, not only for this
      year's current class, but any others that come later. These cameras will
      ensure high quality images at every event, even if the designated
      photographers are unavailable. By contributing to this fundraiser, you
      will be enabling a group of students to increase the school's visibility
      so that more high schoolers will hear about our opportunity.
